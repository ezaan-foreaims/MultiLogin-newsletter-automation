## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezaanamin/MultiLogin-newsletter-automation.git
cd MultiLogin-newsletter-automation
```

2. **Create a `.env` file** in the project root:

```env
USERNAME=nils@keaz.app
PASSWORD=YOUR_MULTILOGIN_PASSWORD
MLX_BASE=https://api.multilogin.com
MLX_LAUNCHER_V2=https://launcher.mlx.yt:45001/api/v2
FOLDER_ID=b749e3ad-c25d-41ad-8285-1843505be99f
```

> Replace `YOUR_MULTILOGIN_PASSWORD` with your actual password or a secure token.

3. **Prepare input files**

* `websites.txt`: List of websites to sign up for newsletters (one per line)
* Email pool is defined in `config.py` (you can modify as needed)

---

## Running the Bot

```bash
python main.py
```

* The bot authenticates with MultiLogin, starts profiles, and navigates through each website.
* Fills newsletter forms with human-like typing and submits them.
* Results are saved to `results_TIMESTAMP.json`.

---

## Example `.env.example`

```
USERNAME=your_email@example.com
PASSWORD=your_multilogin_password
MLX_BASE=https://api.multilogin.com
MLX_LAUNCHER_V2=https://launcher.mlx.yt:45001/api/v2
FOLDER_ID=your_folder_id_here
```

> Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials.

---

## Notes

* Ensure your MultiLogin profiles are configured correctly.
* Use a VPN or proxies if needed.
* Avoid running too many profiles simultaneously to prevent detection.
* Review logs carefully for errors or failed submissions.

### ✅ **Next Steps**

1. Create `requirements.txt`:

```

playwright
requests

````

2. Create `.env` based on `.env.example`.
3. Run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
python main.py
````

If you want, I can **also restructure your Python project into multiple files (`config.py`, `utils.py`, `main.py`)** so it’s cleaner and ready to run with this README.

Do you want me to do that?
